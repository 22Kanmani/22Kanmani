Passion starts as I want to explore new things. Profession starts when I'm having eyes on the designs and colors. Life is always unpredictable!! My interest is at the intersection of these fields â€“ Engineering and Data Science. I want to be building and designing products in real life that are as close to magic.

Started as an Intern in a startup, pulled up a long way to be an Associate Software Developer at GeakMinds where explored a lot of things with nice ambience and good work culture. Played and learnt about the web design and development by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular and ReactJs. With own interest learnt about the basics of PHP, Selenium Web Driver and Deployment process using Azure. 

Strong engineering professional with a Bachelor of technology(B.Tech) focused in Electronics and Communication engineering from Periyar Maniammai University.
